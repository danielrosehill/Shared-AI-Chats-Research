All right, the purpose of this um this prompt is to capture some uh context data as usual for uh a tool that I would be very happy, would love to have. Um not something that I feel so strongly about that I'd go out and try to vape code, although with barriers to entry to vape coding become so so low, it's almost tempting to to do so very flippantly. But this one is this one would actually be a seriously useful one and seriously useful tool. I'm really surprised it doesn't exist. So I'm going to describe in detail um what it is that would be helpful and for what kind of use case. Um, and then we're then we're going to I'm going to use this repo to try search find anything because it's about a year, I'd say since I saw uh asked did anyone, did has anyone made this because I think it would be really useful. So, um, ChatGPT, that's about GPT by OpenAI is my daily kind of AI um user interface/ you know, robotic life companion, muse, um and I ask it a bunch of things and um a lot of those are things uh so my wife and I have, we have a workspace now in Chat GPT, which I set up because I figured that we were both paying for it. And I created a couple of AI assistance what OpenAI called um custom custom GPTs. Uh I created one a parenting one because we use it for mutually use it for parenting and we've both found it actually pretty incredible as a resource as in very high rating. It does a good job and not being like being informative, not being um what's the word? Kind of over the top causing us to panic, like a terrific resource for getting quick parenting advice that neither of us would want to be without. And we've I think we both feel pretty indebted to it. Um the method for sharing is a few things in ChatGPT is the most famous of the AI tools that from the very start I have made no sense to me that uh these features don't exist. One of them is outputs sharing or saving like being able to share chat history easily to like Google Drive or Confluence or whatever you want to put it. Um still not really a feature that's implemented at all. Um and the other one is multi-user chats and that's basically what I'm talking about here. So in an example, I'm just about to run a prompt on ChatGPT asking it for um I want to know about smart speakers because we're kind of both doing requiring to be hands free a bit more than we used to, but also because it's just cool tech. I'd love to get a like always listening smart speaker for home assistant. I know there are such things that has a wake word and I can say, hey, whatever, hey Jim, uh turn on the strip light in my office. So I could run this prompt and I want to share it with my wife in this case because if we're sharing a budget, um like I'd probably ask it for, you know, for cost, like what are we talking is like a $200 purchase, $300 purchase, $50 purchase. Um and that's the first reason because we're sharing money and you know, I want to say like, hey, this is these are the options I got. And the second one would be to create like a a joint chat experience where she might say, oh uh what about I heard this speaker is good as well and then I can see her response. So it's not really very, you know, complicated concept this idea of multiple users interacting with an AI agent or sorry tool. And I know that from a architectural standpoint, you know, I'm thinking through the mechanics of you have an agent, the system prompt could be you're going to be encountering two users. User one um the all their messages are going to be prepended by their name. So the so the without any sophisticated tooling, the the the um LLM knows who's sending it, that they don't need to say I am, it's me Daniel. Um and that can be whether it's a voice utility, text, whatever the modality, that can simply be baked into the API level because it's a different user sending the messages. And it's just a case then I guess of a session that holds in place one agent, one chat history and two users. So to my mind, it's actually just a front-end engineering issue that just has received little attention and little little tooling, but I've no doubt, maybe being over optimistic that it could be done. Um I think this is probably better than my original version of this prompt because I talked about the deficits like in the current implementation in ChatGPT. Um, I just tried to use the share button and now that I'm on a workspace, it says share uh what's it tell me to do? Share the chat. It used to be a a privacy disaster because it was just sharing a public if you wanted to share and I think this is still the case for for private customers or for people not in workspaces, I mean. It'll just share it like security by obscurity. It's a publicly unauthenticated link which I never felt comfortable doing. This is a little better. Um it gives me a link that it says only people in the works workspace can see. And I'm just going to try make sure that's the case. Yeah, it is authenticated, very nice. But if I ask my wife to open this link, it's like a snapshot, it's like a retrospective snapshot of of the chat. Um, it's like this is what I had. You can't it's you can't continue it, you can't. So it's not really that that might be kind of a nice thing to have maybe in tandem with an actual multi-user chat thing. But I would say there's less times that this would be helpful because if I had a really good, you know, useful chat with an AI tool and wanted to share it, my inclination would be to kind of copy and paste parts of the chat and say, this is really useful from I got this from ChatGPT. I wouldn't typically want to share the whole unredacted back and forth because it's like going to be a bunch of irrelevant you know, stuff. Um, so the multi chat would actually be for my use case, far more helpful. If you go back to the parenting assistant that I did, that I mentioned and it could be general as in you could have a general system prompt just a general purpose chat conversation experience or you could have the assistant layer that custom GPTs did where you just basically have a system prompt and I could have my, you know, parenting advisor and we can we can uh either of us can drop in. Now, I guess in the multi-user prompting, you're kind of thinking it opens up new possibilities like um, for example, you could be passively you could be like a passive participant in a in a chat. Um, so you'd have to like go in the the user who you know, you might interact and the other person could open up a chat that you're in. So it's like a group chat essentially. Um, so that that that's where my description of what would be helpful and what would what I'm envisioning uh ends and here's where my question begins. So firstly, anything doing exactly what I'm looking for in terms of bringing the whole package together, conversational AI, multi-users, AI assistance. I think a lot of what ChatGPT does with workspaces is really nicely designed and really smart. Um, but maybe this is something they're like, you know, planning to roll out eventually. Uh, but this would be the thing that would be really, really immensely helpful for me. Um, and that's number one, commercial products, software as a service. Option two or Avenue two is in the world of open source. Uh there's two things specifically that I mentioned might be helpful. Number one is open source projects. Has someone tried to has someone tried this? Number two is components. I mentioned, I'd love to get a feedback from you on the technical viability of this idea. I mentioned the challenge it like it's it brings with us architectural and state management and session management considerations. Um, what's what's the feasibility like in terms of doing this? Um, and that's it really. I'd love to get, you know, is if there is something like this, if there are open source projects and architectural considerations and finally uh components. So if there are any specific front end or chat UI components intended for this niche but very specific use case. Um, the final thing I just want to add at the risk of making this very long is thinking out loud a bit. Two, two is one thing. A chat with one robot and two users is one specific thing. Um, it might be the case that like is there any reason that that couldn't be extended? If if there's a tool like this that can that can hold two users, why couldn't you have like your group chat, like literally a um, you know, a family having its family AI bot in chats, um, or friends or whatever, you could extend the concept however you wish. At a certain point, I think it would run into natural scaling challenges. If we talk about the bot needing to know who's who. If you had a bot that was like the Discord server bot and there was 10,000 users, by the time it got that context data, it would be out of context. So and it would just be completely chaotic if you had, you know, one bot trying to like visibly interact with an entire uh with like 10,000 people at once. So I'm thinking more in the niche use case but maybe two, you know, two to four users, let's say.
